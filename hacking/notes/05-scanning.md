# Scanning

We'll use free vulnerable virtual machines for study porpuses
We'll fetch information about the technologies the target uses.

We'll look for open ports in the target

- 21: ftp
- 22: ssh
- 25: smtp
- 53: dns
- 80: http
- 443: https

If there's a vulnerable software running in one of these open ports, then the target is vulnerable

Our goal is to find open ports and exploit the target that runs vulnerable software on that open port.
