# Vulnerability Analysis

- Nmap has an engine to create scripts to perform common scanning and vulnerability analysis

Link: `https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html`

OBS: nse stands for nmap scripts engine

## Nmap scripts

### Running script groups

`sudo nmap --script {auth, banner, exploit} {HOST} -sS`

### Running single scripts

- nmap scripts are stored in /usr/share/nmap/scripts

Get documentation about the script

`sudo nmap --scripts-help {SCRIPT_NAME}.nse`

Running script:

`sudo nmap --script {SCRIPT_NAME}.nse {HOST}`

> **Vulnerabilities of Metasploitable machine:**  
> `sudo nmap --script auth {HOST}` -> Tomcat vulnerability  
> `sudo nmap --script ftp-anon.nse {HOST}` -> ftp vulnerability

## Manual Vulnerability Analysis

Just search exploits at google for the software and the version running on the target.  
Example: `apache httpd 2.2.8 exploit`

### searchsploit

Given a software version, this tool searchs for exploits already downloaded in our kali linux machine.

`searchsploit UnrealIRCd`

## Nessus

Great tool that scans a target for vulnerabilities.
Free plan: 16 local IP addresses per 90 days.
