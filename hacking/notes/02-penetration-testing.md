# Penetration Testing

- We need to have permission to perform a penetration test
- Trying to hack something you're not allowed could get you into trouble if you get caught.

## 5 Stages of Penetration Test

1. Information Gathering / Reconnaissance
2. Scanning
3. Gaining access / Exploitation
4. Maintaining Access
5. Covering tracks


### 1- Information Gathering / Reconnaissance

The act of gathering information about your target to better plan your attack.
This step can be done without permission, since it's not illegal.

### 2- Scanning

Here's where you can start getting in trouble if you do it without permission.
It's a deeper form of information gathering.
Find gateways, open ports, vulnerability scanning.

### 3- Gaining access / Exploitation

This is the step where we acctually hack and gain access to the target.
After this step you can consider penetration test to be successfull.

### 4- Maintaining Access

It is commonlly done by installing back doors and plating root kits.
These are programs that will allow us to gain access to that target whenever we want without having to exploit it again.

### 5- Covering tracks

Removing all evidences that an attack ever took place.
This can involve deleting/hiding files, editing logs, or reverting changes you made to the system.
